# Doodl

Doodl is the Swiss Army knife of data visualization. It has several audiences:

- Folks who want to write documents in Markdown that include high quality
  interactive (output format permitting) visualizations.

- Data analysts and data scientists who use any of the several Jupyter notebook
  derivative platforms to do data science.

- Web developers who would like to easily add charts and graphs to their Web
  apps in any of the major Web app platforms (work in progress).

- And soon, chatbot and other gen AI developers who would like their products
  to include high quality graphs and charts.

Under the hood, doodl is based on [d3](http://d3js.org), which means that
anything that you can do in d3, you can do in a PDF, Jupyter notebook, Web
app or a chatbot.

Here's a quick guide to what you'll find in the documentation:

- The [getting started guide](/get-started) will step you through how to
  set up doodl and get going.

- Some general topics like [invoking doodl](/invoking) and
  [color palettes](/colors)
  explain doodl in action.

- Each of the [chart types](/charts/intro) is documented individually,
  with examples.

- Finally, some special topics like [doodl's history](/history),
  [building your own chart types](/custom/) and
  [using matplotlib (and more) with doodl](/pandoc-plot)
  will turn you into a doodl expert in no time.

We hope that you enjoy using doodl as much as we've enjoyed building it.
